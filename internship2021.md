### Internship 2021: BMWNA's Autonomous Driver Team

As part of the autonomous driving engineering team, I analyze fleet data with focus on advanced driver assistance systems. As the team's data science intern, I research US safety requirements and extract insights using large-scale data science applications that support feature optimization initiatives.
