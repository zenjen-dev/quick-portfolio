### Internship 2022: BMWNA's Autonomous Driver Team

As part of the autonomous vehicles engineering team, I analyze fleet data with focus on advanced driver assistance systems. In my internship, I extract insights using large-scale data science applications, supporting feature optimization initiatives for upcoming vehicle releases. 

My main tools in this role are PySpark for large-scale data processing, and AWS for data management.
